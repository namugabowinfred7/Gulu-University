    <h2>About GU</h2>
    <p>
In 2001 a Technical Task Force was appointed to set up the University. Because of the insecurity in Gulu at the time,
the Team set up a temporary office at Lincoln Flat 4 at Makerere University. The Task Force consisted of Dr. J.H. Pen
Mogi Nyeko , Prof. Mary. J.N. Okwakol ,Dr. Stephen Tikodri , and Mr N. Peter Egwel Odyomo. The office relocated to Gulu
in early 2002.

        In October 2002 the University opened at the District Farm Institute located on Awich Street in Laroo Division, Gulu
        Municipality.

            <b>Initially,</b> the University was named Gulu University of Agriculture and Environmental Science and was to
            specialize in
            agricultural mechanization. However, it was later proposed that the University should widen its scope beyond
            agricultural mechanization and produce high level human resource that can effectively participate in solving the
            social
            and economic problems of the country. It was then renamed Gulu University.
            From 2002 the University steadily increased its intake, faculties and programmes due to the demand to satisfy
            practical
            needs regionally, nationally, and internationally.
            The University now has six faculties and two institutes:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Faculty of Medicine,</li>
            <li>Faculty of Agriculture and Environment,</li>
            <li>Faculty of Science,</li>
            <li>Faculty of Education and Humanities,</li>
