          <h2>Welcome Notes to Students.</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to Gulu University (GU). Our goal is to provide you with resources that help enrich both the student experience
            and campus life here at GU. <br> The Dean of Students’ Department is home to several services on campus, including Residence
            Life, Spiritual Life, Student Engagement and Guidance and Counseling Services. Each of these services plays a key role
            in providing you with everything you need to find academic success while enjoying the comforts of our campus community.
            We also host Orientation Week and Fresher’s Ball as some of our biggest events of the year! <br> During orientation week, we
            kick off the start of the academic year with events on campus that help welcome all students, new and returning, to
            campus.
            <br><br>
            As a new student, you really don’t want to miss orientation activities since it helps you get your way around the campus
            socially, academically and spiritually with ease! Otherwise, you might struggle, among others, to find a lecture room
            for a particular course and end up missing the formative academic activities of your programme! <br> You may also fail to sit
            for exams because you would not have known what to do before going to an examination room! We hope we can provide you
            with everything you need to immerse yourself in Campus Life and enjoy a full campus experience!
