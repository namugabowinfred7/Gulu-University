        Orientation is one of the most important university programmes to be attended by every first year student. During this
        week, the office of the Dean of Students and the Guild Government use it to welcome and provide a caring environment to
        the first year students. We ask all first year students to attend orientation to cover topical issues on:
        <br><br>
        Welfare, security and accommodation of students in the University
        Students’ clubs and associations
        Guild administration and leadership
        Students’ spiritual life in the University
        Students’ joining instructions, registration and change of programme. <br> <br>
        <b>Library services</b><br>
        University organs and administration
        Functions of Lower Local Government – provision of security, and social services to students
        Academic programmes at respective faculties and institutes.
