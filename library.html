                <h2>WELCOME TO GULU UNIVERSITY LIBRARY</h2>
        
                    Gulu University (GU) Library congratulates you upon being offered a higher education opportunity at Gulu
                    University. At
                    this stage of your life’s journey, you are considered adult enough to take decisions that may shape your
                    future.
                    However, it is still important that you are further supported in your academic endeavors for a better
                    future.
        <br><br>
                    It is therefore important for you to, at the very start, understand the structure of the GU’s Library and
                    Information
                    Services (LIS). LIS offers a number of services that are directed towards improving your academic experience
                    while at
                    the University and after the University life. <br> To start with, LIS department’s mandate is to plan, organize,
                    direct,
                    control, coordinate and manage all University Library and Information services. This is emphasized in
                    Statute 85 of
                    2005, which requires the department to put in place all the necessary Information and Communication
                    Technologies aimed
                    at easing stakeholders’ access to information. <br> By understanding LIS structure, you will know where to get
                    help, direct
                    suggestions and complains. Read More…
